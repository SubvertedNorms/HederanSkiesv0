[b]Chapter One: Thunderstorm[/b]

Dark clouds billow overhead, black as chimney smoke, blotting out sky and earth as the deck rocks back and forth like a cradle beneath your feet. As captain, it's your job to navigate the airship safely through the storm and deliver your client's cargo intact. Unfortunately, you weren't expecting the wind to hit such speeds while crossing the Blackreef Channel.  

You close the door to the captain's cabin behind you as the airship skirts the rumbling storm clouds, suspended by frayed ropes that strain against the wind to hold the balloon in place. The balloon itself, discolored from years of use, stretches the full length of the hull, enveloping the crew in a forbidding shadow. 

A hulking woman ducks beneath the swaying ropes and advances toward you. Her narrowed eyes and gritted teeth give her an unfriendly look. She keeps the sides and back of her head shaved, although she lets her bangs — which have grown several inches in length — part sideways across her face, partially concealing the dragonship tattoo that curls along her right cheek bone. 

"What's going on out here?" you ask. "I told the crew not to take any shortcuts. We're a thousand feet in the air. If anyone falls overboard right now..." 

"Sorry, Captain. We were blown off course. The storm is far worse than expected," Kaolin Windrider replies. Heavy torrents of rain crash against the weathered hull as she hurriedly adjusts some rigging. "Nobody bothered to secure the cargo while the winds were calm. There's just no procedure in place for times like these."

You suppose you should have remembered how inept the crew is. The former captain, Pyritos, didn't bother to train anyone properly. 

Normally the cargo would be secured well before departure, when the airship was docked safely on firm land or floating steadily in the water of some port, but your client was in a hurry to be rid of the cargo before the inspection patrol came around and he demanded that you take to the skies immediately.

Kaolin rubs the back of her neck sheepishly. "We managed to get some of the cargo into the hold but -" Kaolin stumbles forward as a violent gust of wind strikes the hull, knocking you both off your feet.

As your body tumbles through the air in sickening circles, you're reminded of a circus act you once watched in your home town. Your head jerks sideways as you collide with a rail. Sharp pain spreads out from your temple. 

In a crack of thunder, the wind changes direction, jolting the ship violently and transforming the entire deck into a deadly obstacle course. Unsecured crates slide from one side of the deck to the other, knocking unwary deckhands off their feet. You shout to a nearby deckhand but he doesn't heed your call. He can't hear you, and you aren't surprised. With rain pelting your face, you can't even tell who he is. 

You scramble to your feet as several containers hurtle toward you. Every instinct screams at you to leap aside. Get seriously injured and you'll have to relinquish your position as captain, but step aside and your client's valuable crates will slide overboard.

    "No!" Kaolin rushes forward too late, spitting curses as the precious cargo vanishes into the dark clouds below. "That's a quarter of our haul down the drain. If the storm doesn't kill us, our client will!"

    "The crates were moving too fast. There was no way to stop them safely," you say. "Besides, we still might be able to deliver the rest of the cargo intact - assuming we can secure the crates before the next gale strikes."

    Your elbows buckle as a crate slams into your outstretched arms. Seconds later, another crate slams into your leg. Screaming in pain, you hold your stance and bring the crates to a halt.

    Kaolin rushes over to help. "You okay?"

    "I'll live." You wince and touch the tender areas where the crates collided with your body. Truth be told, you'll be lucky if your leg fully recovers. 

    Kaolin breathes a sigh of relief. "Color me impressed. I thought any prospect of resupplying our dwindling food supply was gone!" 

    "We're not out of the storm yet," you say warningly. "We need to secure the other crates before the next gale strikes."

    "Kaolin! Stop the crates!" you order.

    Your voice can barely be heard over the howling wind, yet Kaolin springs to action, blocking the gap in the rail with her muscular frame. Her elbows buckle as a crate slams into her outstretched arms. She nearly collapses as another slams into her leg.  

    You quickly run forward and pull the precious crates to safety. "Whew. Didn't think you'd be able to stop them both."

    "Nice of you to stand by and watch," Kaolin grumbles as she rubs her leg with a wince. 

    You certainly didn't gain any favors with Kaolin, but it is thanks to her that you might be able to deliver the cargo intact - assuming you can secure the crates before the next gale strikes.

You try to calm your nerves, but it's not easy. The storage room is empty. Food rations are low. Even the rats don't go near your airship anymore. It might as well be a floating coffin. Deckhands were barging into your cabin since the crack of dawn singing of empty bellies and light pockets. With your clients' valuable cargo now scattered across the deck, threatening to plummet miles through the air into the sea, financial ruin looks inevitable. 

You've dealt with worse situations in the past, but not many.

Nearby, the boatswain finishes dragging a thick rope around another crate. Kaolin hurries over, feet sliding across the slick floorboards, to offer a hand. You move to help just as the ship begins rolling and pitching again. Several deckhands wretch and fall to their knees. Their slippery vomit coats the deck.

Frustrated and queasy, you search for the silver lining in all this mess. Nobody is fatally wounded and most of the crates are still scattered across the deck. You could help gather them together but it might be wiser to stop the ship from drifting further into the storm...

Grasping the airship's railing tightly in one hand, you make your way to the main deck while slivers of wood dig into your iron grip. 

Unlike a seafaring ship, the massive captain's wheel has been replaced with a console. The three officers stationed there work together to operate a complicated assortment of levers and buttons. 

You could try steering the airship back on course by yourself or request assistance from the officers - though they clearly have no idea what they're doing if they're still heading deeper into the storm...

    "Here. Let me help." You settle behind the central console panel and patiently give instructions to the officers as they adjust the gas and ballast boards. "Stabilize the trim. We're heavy in the tail."

    Everyone seems comfortable working with you even though your rank far exceeds theirs. However, the airship refuses to stay on course.

    "The rudder lever won't budge," one of the officers says in a panicked voice. "It's been tempermental all day."

    "Looks like it's rusted. Here. Let me try." Channeling all your strength into one arm, you shove the rusted rudder lever sideways and get the airship back on course. "Oil the joints and it'll be good as new," you say before leaving the control panel in their care.

    Immediately the officer to your left adjusts the ballast board, his fingers dancing quickly across the panel. As the deck levels out, you help the other officers adjust the bearing using the same subtle method. With the airship back on course, you leave the control panel in their care.

    You shove all three officers away and settle yourself behind the central console panel. The gas and ballast boards can be adjusted with ease but the rusted rudder lever refuses to budge. You throw your weight against it. 

    When the airship finally turns it's a miracle. Sliding behind the console again, you operate all three control panels with sheer determination, instructing the officers to oil the rusted lever while you navigate toward the eye of the storm. 

    "There. I've corrected our course. Now keep heading straight," you tell them before relinquishing the controls.

Next, you hear a fight break out nearby, with Quartermaster Ruby Reed trying to convince Jasper Lazulus, the fifty-seven year old ship's surgeon, to remain outside. "As the only active surgeon on board, you should be on deck at all times helping the wounded!"  

"Why? So I can get struck down by the same crate that hit him?" Dr. Lazulus gestures impatiently at a fallen deckhand with a blood-soaked ankle. "Then what?"

"It's as simple as stepping aside," Ruby growls. "Now get to work or –" 

"Or what? You'll throw me overboard? Confound you, woman!" Dr. Lazulus shouts. "Happily I wash my hands of you, your demands, and this enterprise of tomfoolery!" The cow-eyed, curly haired surgeon lunges for the door but Ruby blocks it with her arm. 

"I don't think so," Ruby says warningly, tilting her head higher as a flicker of lightning illuminates her threatening eyes. "You'll at least tend the wounded before I let you back inside."

"What good am I to anyone dead? Now let me by or we'll see how well this disaster-prone crew of half-wits fares without a surgeon of my caliber to piece and patch it back together!" 
*fake_choice
  #"Cut it out you two!" 
  #"Calm down. There's no reason to overact."
  #"Why are my highest ranking officers behaving like children?"

You're about to step between the surgeon and quartermaster when lightning clips the underbelly of the clouds, causing the airship to wrench like a beached whale. 

Sienna, the eight-year-old cabin girl, crashes over the rail. Her shrill scream is swallowed by a rumble of thunder. Miraculously, she manages to latch on to the rigging but her trembling fingers keep slipping on the wet ropes. If the poor girl loses her grip, her body will plummet for miles. What will eventually break her fall, earth or sea, you can't tell because the sky beneath the airship is shrouded by clouds. 

The emergency sails unfurl seconds later, fanning out like wings. Normally these sails are only released in preparation for sea travel but someone clearly failed to secure them. A few deckhands rush to the quarterdeck and desperately attempt to haul the sails back in. 

Any moment now a strong gust of wind could catch in those fluttering deathtraps and capsize the entire ship. Although the deckhands are trying to tether them down, they're doing it wrong. If you don't help them you'll surely lose some cargo...

If there's one thing you don't want right now, with so many injured on board, it's your invaluable quartermaster and talented surgeon at each other's throats. So when you see Dr. Lazulus with brow furrowed and medical case raised high overhead, you realize somebody is about to get the worse end of a bloody nose. You dodge past the crates sliding over the edge, ignore Sienna's pleas for help, and take several long strides toward the two top-level deckhands. 

Unsurprisingly, Dr. Lazulus's stance isn't threatening Ruby at all. Instead Ruby swells like a balloon, thrusting her chest forward, peeling her toned shoulders back, and tilting her chin so it juts out defiantly. When you leap between them, Dr. Lazulus starts in surprise and immediately begins spitting words from his lips. "Aha! If it isn't the good captain! Such a pleasure to see you! Unexpected even! What with the, uh, how should we put it? Deadly precipitation of projectile crates?" 

"What's going on here?" you demand as Dr. Lazulus stashes the medical case behind his back while shaping his mouth into a poor attempt at a smile. 

"You've indubitably had the misfortune of overhearing a portion of the disagreement between myself and this prodigious lunatic who so recently ordered me to jeopardize life and limb by remaining on deck. Indeed! Put myself at risk when injured personnel could simply be carried below deck where I could tend to them in the safety of the —"

"Who has time to be dragging people below deck at a time like this?" Ruby demands. She focuses a smoldering glower on Dr. Lazulus that would make an ordinary man wither into the floorboards. "The stinkin' cowardice, am I right?"

    Dr. Lazulus smirks at Ruby. "There! You see? I was right. Even the captain agrees."

    Ruby slams her fist against the rail. "What's the point of having a surgeon on board if he spends the entire time hiding?"

    *if diplomacy > 40
      "Look Ruby, he won't be able dodge crates while tending wounds," you say reasonably. 

      "But some of the deckhands are hurt so badly they can't even crawl to safety!" Ruby argues. "Are you saying we should abandon them?"

      "If we don't get the ship under control soon we're going to lose everyone. Just look over there!" you say, pointing urgently at the port-side rigging. "The cabin girl's about to fall to her doom, and I'm stuck here arguing with you two."

      "Wait... Sienna's in trouble?" Ruby's eyes widen as the information sinks in. A moment later, the quartermaster turns on her heels and races to Sienna's rescue. 

      Dr. Lazulus grunts a word of thanks before heading below deck.

      Dr. Lazulus skulks inside without a word of thanks.

      Ruby fingers the dagger on her belt, simmering with rage. You don't blame her. 

      "He's insufferable," you admit. "But we don't have much choice until we find someone better. For now, we should try to do something about the cabin girl. She's about to slip off the port-side rigging."

      Dr. Lazulus glares at you. "Stuck with me, are you? Well, if that's how you feel I'll take my leave. Once we get somewhere civilized I'm out."

      Dr. Lazulus hesitates, his beady eyes darting back and forth as he calculates his response. "Ah... I suppose I could help. I didn't think anyone noticed how much I've put on the line lately. A pay raise certainly wouldn't go amiss. Dangerous work this ship business."

You shove past the squabbling deckhaads, leap over the crates that are sliding overboard, and peer over the rail to find Sienna staring up at you in terror. 

Her fingertips are turning pale as she struggles to maintain her grip on the rigging. When you lock eyes with her, Sienna gulps and tries to put on a brave face for your sake.

"Captain!" Sienna's lips tremble. The muscles in her undeveloped arms are straining to carry the weight of her body. They could seize up any moment.

You'd like to know who thought it was a good idea to bring a child aboard a smuggling ship.

The rain has made the rigging so slick that you're about to lose your grip.

As you desperately consider your next move, you recall a memory from your final disasterous mission with ex-Captain Pyritos. Several crates had smashed open, scattering illegal adrenaline pills across the deck. You were still finding them between cracks in the floorboards and stuffing them into your pockets so your deckhands wouldn't succumb to them. Now you can't help but wonder if they could be of use in this increasingly desperate situation. 

With an adrenaline boost, you'd definitely have the speed and reflexes to save Sienna. On the other hand, it's addictive and overpowering to the point where you could completely lose control. 

You reach into your pocket and consider taking one the adrenaline pills.

She dangles from her ankle, suspended upside down at the end of the rope, with blood trickling down her leg from the wound. You look up and see a shadowy figure perched on the rail. 

      "Pull her up, Cap'n. 'Fore she dies of blood loss." The voice belongs to quartermaster Ruby Reed. She's tying her end of the rope to the rail. Before you can thank Ruby, she hops down from the ledge and disappears from sight.

      Meanwhile, Sienna swings back and forth below, limply, gently, like a pendulum. As you rush to the rail and begin hauling on the rope, you realize Sienna must have passed out from shock. You carefully lift Sienna's body over the rail and lower her to the deck. "Call the surgeon!" 

      "Would have done so already but he's below deck refusing to come up," the boatswain answers. 

      "Take her to him then," you say impatiently. "He'll walk the plank if Sienna dies."

When you bellow for order you hear shouts of exasperation mixed with sighs of relief. Deckhands who were vomiting all over the deck only moments ago, wipe their mouths and cast nervous eyes on you. 

The former captain's inefficient tyranny has taken a toll on their finances and also their confidence.

Gathering the crates together should be a simple task, only it's not. You watch several crates glide dangerously across the deck as a handful of disorganized men and women chase after them. When the deckhands attempted to secure a stack of crates with rope and netting earlier the crates still slid around and, before long, broke free. 

As you survey the situation, an elderly deckhand shambles up from the back of the group. Slater is short and feeble-looking. Wrinkles creep from the corners of his eyes to his temples, so deep they look like flaps of elephant skin. His breeches are pulled high on his waistline and a ridiculous furry hat with flaps covers his ears and head. 

"Captain, might I make a suggestion?" 

"Of course," you say. "What do you have in mind?"  

"See those thick metal cylinders on either side of the deck? They're bollards. By threading the rope around the notches in the deck and then wrapping the rope around the bollards we can prevent the crates from sliding around," Slater explains.

          With a few precise adjustments, you exit the updraft safely. The airship pierces the storm clouds, breaching clear skies at last. "How's the air quality?" you inquire while stabilizing the ballast.

          "Should be safe to cruise along at our current altitude," the helmsman responds.

          "Then I'll leave you to it," you say, relinquishing the controls and returning to the main deck. "All hands: secure the cargo!" It should be an easy task now.

          You pull both levers back as far as they will go, letting the balloon swell and rise into the sky, urging the ship higher, eager to leave the storm clouds behind. 

          Suddenly your head starts spinning. Your grip tightens on the levers. The airship rises higher and higher until you realize that you've flown too high. The air becomes thinner, making it difficult to breathe. Beside you, the officer at the gas board sways dizzily and collapses from lack of oxygen. 

          Terrified at the onset of dizziness, you shove the levers forward, lowering the airship beneath the clouds until you're once again enveloped in the storm. Several crates tumble overboard due to the jerky movements.

          The crew is shaken and the remaining crates continue to slide across the deck. You wasted your time for nothing, though you have noted the dangers of sailing too high. Perhaps for now it's best to let Slater get on with his work.

    *set agility %+10

      At first you stay near Slater, sliding one crate after the other to his assistants. Once everyone has a crate, you head further across the deck. It takes longer to secure a crate than it does to fetch one. 

      Keeping this in mind, you move the crates closer to the deckhands, sliding them to whoever finishes next. 
      *goto PC_secured

    *else
      *set cargo %-25
      You head toward the furthest crates near the edge, fearing they might slide overboard. It takes time to slide them toward Slater's assistants since they're so far away. Most of the deckhands end up waiting around with nothing to do.

      You then return to the crates that were initially close to the deckhands and find that most have slid further away. Some topple overboard before you can reach them. You let out a grunt of frustration.

      By the time you get the remaining crates together it's hard to tell how many you've lost. You wasted your time for nothing. Perhaps for now it's best to let Slater get on with his work.

  You decide to check on Sienna. She's unconscious with blood dripping down her leg as Ruby carries her to the forecastle. "Not now, Cap'n. She's in a terrible state." Ruby's face is shadowed by her hood, making her expression unreadable. "I think her leg might need to be amputated..."

  "Maybe Dr. Lazulus can save it," you say hopefully.

  "I wouldn't trust the man to tie his own boots, but we'll see I suppose," Ruby says, reaching for the knob.

  "Hold up," you say. "It might be better if someone else took her below. The two of you aren't exactly on good terms."

  Ruby responds with a reluctant look. It's the truth and everybody knows it. Carefully she transfers Sienna from her arms to the nearest deckhand. "Take her to the infirmary. Tell Dr. Lazulus I want her back on her feet by evening. He'll walk the plank if he refuses."

  The deckhand nods and carries Sienna through the door. You're about to ask Ruby for help when the crate Slater is using for his demonstration slides from his grasp, collides with your leg and smashes open, spilling rotten cabbages across the deck.

In a moment of confusion, the deckhands stare in awe at the cheap produce they put their lives on the line to ship safely across the continent. Then all their questions are answered as a beautiful, sparkling gem of exquisite turquoise color unfolds from the leaves and rolls across the deck.

Ruby slams her foot down on the gem, leans over, and retrieves it from the floor, raising it to eye-level for inspection. "It's a geminai core. Highly refined. Fashioned into a jewel for the elite from the looks of it." Ruby purses her lips and looks at you expectantly.  

When you stretch out your hand and take the sparkling orb from Ruby you're surprised at the intense warmth radiating from the surface and seeping into your fingers. The core is alive with steady rhythmic contractions pulsating within. Pulses that match your own heartbeats. 

In Tethyr, geminai co-exist peacefully with humans. By outward appearance it's impossible to tell them apart. The geminai look the same as humans, but have cores instead of hearts. As far as you know, you've never met one, yet they could be members of your crew. They generally keep quiet about it since cutthroat killers occasionally go after them for their valuable cores. You wouldn't be flaunting it either if someone wanted to turn your insides into jewelry.

In the neighboring country of Lyon, geminai cadavers belonged to the state. But in Tethyr the body of a geminai was considered sacred and given a proper burial, which can only mean one thing. "Our client is slaughtering geminai for profit." 

"Exactly," says Ruby, lowering her voice. "This is the black market we're dealing with."

Although you feel unsettled you try not to let it show on your face because the deckhands are watching.
