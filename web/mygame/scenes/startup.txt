When Hedera's two races, human and geminai, are divided by the newly legalized geminai hunts, geminai are forced to flee, increasing business opportunities for high-risk smugglers like yourself. On the other hand, hunting geminai for their highly lucrative cores could save you and your crew from financial destitution, but only if you are willing to compromise your morals and betray the geminai in your own crew first. 

Will you become a beloved captain or a tyrant of the skies? Will you save the geminai from extinction or betray them for profit? Can you stop a medical corporation from exploiting geminai lives for profit? And can you end a war by making the king listen to reason?
