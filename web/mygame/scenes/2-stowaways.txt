Ancient oak floorboards creak beneath your feet as you lean back in your chair, wondering how to tackle the piles of paperwork on your desk. The candle stub next to your elbow flickers, its wick barely visible in a puddle of melted wax. You desperately scrape the wax together to salvage the remains of your candle. You know it's the last candle left.

From the musky smell of the rotting floorboards you estimate the airship undertook its maiden voyage nearly two centuries ago, yet despite the airship's questionable condition, your former captain, Pyritos, never managed to pay off the debts and surmounting interest owed upon it. Instead, he secretly gambled away every tethla the crew ever made. 

Truth be told, you had ambitions of your own. Although you began life as an unwanted orphan, and struggled to grow up in one of the roughest orphanages to disgrace the realm, you were determined to fashion yourself into something better. When Captain Pyritos first brought you aboard you knew that his airship and tricorn hat had to be yours. And, just as planned, you became the next captain.

    Some deckhands jokingly called you the peacemaker who could "defuse a powder keg with words." You didn't just walk a mile in someone's shoes, you could practically slip into their skin and see through their eyes. You saw every problem from at least three different angles. 

    When the crew discovered that Pyritos had gambled away every coin in the treasury, you attempted to negotiate a settlement with him. It almost worked too... until Pyritos panicked and jumped ship. With Pyritos gone, the crew unanimously voted in favor of making you the next captain. If anyone could convince Captain Pyritos's countless disgruntled clients to give the crew a second chance it was you. But could you really pull this crew back from the brink of financial destitution?

    Captain Pyritos should have marooned you when he had the chance, but he made the mistake of demoting you to a common deck swab instead. 

    While Pyritos was waiting for you to come to his cabin and beg to have your old position back, you used his ego and your new position against him, spreading discord amongst your fellow deckhands while swabbing the decks. When collection agencies began harassing Pyritos for "payment," you knew something was amiss and broke into the crew treasury to discover that Pyritos had emptied the room of every last coin. You informed the deckhands and they left Pyritos to rot on an island in the Blackreef channel, thinking that it had been their idea all along. 

    When it came down to choosing the next captain, you flattered your comrades and convinced them that your clever plots and ability to escape nasty situations would make you ideal for the position. But could you really pull this crew back from the brink of financial destitution?

    You never felt quite right with your feet planted on the earth. The only time you felt truly at home was when you were clutching the helm controls in your sweaty hands with the airship at full tilt.

    At some point the crew discovered that Pyritos had gambled away every coin in the treasury. This seemed to bother the deckhands quite a lot, so they deposited Pyritos on some forlorn rock in the middle of the Blackreef Channel. You almost felt sorry for him. Except that you didn't [i]really[/i] care because you still had control of the helm.

    When the crew realized that you were the only one who really knew how to fly the ship, they made you honorary captain, which was all well and good since the ship officially became yours to command.

    The crew was shocked. Before they could reach for their blades, you reminded them how Pyritos would nearly soil his britches whenever a lucrative opportunity appeared. “The risk is too great,” the cowardly captain would mutter before dismissing the opportunity with a wave of his hand. 

    But the risk is exactly what you signed up for! The higher the risk, the greater the reward! That's how it worked. So you promised the crew you could do better - that you could make them rich if they dared follow you. By far the toughest of the deckhands, you used muscle to get your way. If anyone had an issue with you, they could taste the sharp side of your blade. As you saw it, life aboard an airship came down to the survival of the fittest.

    Unfortunately, Captain Pyritos had already gambled away the crew treasury by the time you usurped his position. With enough force, you could cripple your competitors and bully potential clients into hiring you. But could you really pull this crew back from the brink of financial destitution?

You press your fingers to your temples while considering the foreboding documents piled up on the mahogany desk before you: neglected charters, unanswered shipment requests, empty order forms, denied entrance papers, countless fines, and even a few death threats bearing the seals of money lenders and collection agencies. The only thing in your favor is that Pyritos's frequent failures have left the crew completely unknown to authorities so there is no fear of patrol officers meddling in your business.

Suddenly the cabin door swings open, interupting your thoughts. You glance up, expecting the worst, and come face to face with Flint Moore, the lookout; tall and muscular, with a pale complexion and a bright yellow budgie perched on his shoulder, twittering happily without a care in the world.

"Most people knock before entering," you say.

"Most people didn't grow up with you," Flint shrugs. "Besides, I wanted to make sure everything was okay. What are you planning to do about the geminai cores?" 

"I've already made up my mind about that," you reply uneasily. You feel the wind sneaking through cracks in the walls, tickling the back of your neck and spreading goosebumps along your arms. 

"Sounds like you've got everything under control then," Flint says, sounding somewhat unconvinced. "Another ten minutes and we should be able to see Ithora directly below us." Flint shifts his weight over to one hip and scratches the budgie's neck gently with one finger. "...You sure you're okay?"
*choice
  #"I'm fine, but thanks for your concern. It's good to know someone's on my side."
    "Always," Flint says, smirking mischeviously. "Just try to relax a little. No matter how frustrating things get, it's impossible to look bad when your predecessor was Pyritos." 
    *goto lll

  #"Not entirely sure. Didn't think smuggling would involve so many moral crossroads."
    "You always had a habit of picking the worst jobs," Flint laughs.

  #"Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing. But I can't appear indecisive or the crew will fall apart."
    "Don't worry so much about them. It's impossible to look bad when your predecessor was Pyritos," Flint grins. 
    *goto lll

Your lips twitch into a half smile. Although you're concerned about the geminai cores and getting past the checkpoint safely, talking to Flint always puts you at ease. 

You know Flint better than you know any other soul aboard your ship. The two of you grew up together, shared the same revolting porridge every morning at the orphanage, and weathered the same harsh blows from the matron when you failed to complete your chores. You were an inseparable pair.

"Just remember that I'm always ready and willing to jump ship in the middle of the night at your command. All this hard work, remaining vigilant all day, has taken years off my lifespan," Flint says. "I could use some relaxing employment for once, that's for sure." 

"Yeah right. You never want to do [i]anything[/i]," you say, folding your arms and quirking a brow. 

"Finally someone who understands me," Flint spreads his arms open in a sweeping motion that seems to say 'guilty as charged' when the door swings open a second time. You and Flint immediately clamp your mouths shut and wipe the smirks off your faces. Your navigator, Malikye Cavely, just walked in.

"How typical. The two idiots at it again, wasting time like it's cocktail hour." The eccentric man from Trieste habitually mutters scathing comments under his breath, as if you can't hear him. You can't tell if Malikye is doing it on purpose or if it's related to the fact that his breath reeks of alcohol.

Malikye's dark brown eyes lock on yours. For a moment he looks disoriented, almost as if he's noticing you for the first time. "Hmm. Did I say something out loud?"

If it wasn't for his tiresome attitude or the fact that his uniform smells like it's been floating in sewage for a week, he could attract endless admirers. Instead, his lustrous locks cling to his forehead in sweaty clumps, he reeks of alcohol and body odor, and the buttons on his uniform protrude from mismatching holes. 
*comment never match the holes?

It's almost as if he's trying to push people away. You would have dismissed him ages ago if he wasn't so good at finding contracts and charting courses. 

"You've been drinking again," Flint says, narrowing his eyes. You follow his gaze, noticing a half empty bottle in Malikye's pocket.

    "We're trying to help." You stubbornly push the bottle deep into your pocket. "Wasn't there something you wanted to discuss with me?"

    "Er... yes. There certainly was." Malikye rubs his eyes and pushes some of the tangled chestnut mane away from his face. "Why aren't we headed toward some sort of black market? I hear The Mountain is fairly accessible these days. Imagine what a cut we'd get selling those cores ourselves."    *goto flintsmiles

  "Yes, but we'll sell them in Ithora. We're nearly there and I know someone who will take them."

  "In that case, the inspection is still problematic should they decide to check the cargo." Malikye paces back and forth restlessly, premature wrinkles stretching across his forehead like ledger lines. 

  "There's no way around it," you say. 

  "Very well," Malikye sighs. "I'll gather the cores and do away with those damned cabbages. They're just taking up space... along with everything else around here." 
  
  "Hey! Everyone else might be taking up space, but we plan to eat those cabbages!" says Flint.

  "I decided to hand them over to the authorities in Ithora," you tell Malikye.

  "You decided to hand them over to authorities," Malikye echoes hollowly. He begins pacing the room and running his fingers through his hair. "Of course you did. How else could we anger our most influential client and ensure we spend the rest of our days on the run? Who but you could find an option less profitable than fencing the goods ourselves or simply handing them over to our client as promised?" 
  
  Before you can respond, Malikye slams his hands down on the table. "Did you ever consider for one second that you're going to get us all killed?"

*page_break Fifteen Minutes Later...
Once your airship finally escapes the storm, you see Ithora, the greatest city in Valterra, sprawling hundreds of feet below, just as Flint said. It's rather a shock to discover that Ithora bears no resemblance to a city at all. It's more like an expansive palace, housing millions of citizens in its countless extravagant turrets and teardrop domes. Colorful flags displaying family crests flutter from flagpoles on each building. 

Automated carriages traverse the narrow passages of the under-city while pedestrians use drawbridges to travel from one elegant tower to the next. Commoners wear the uniforms of their trade while well-to-do aristocrats wear luxurious silk garments decorated with layers of ruffles and lace. Fancy wide brimmed hats dressed with flowers and fruit perch atop their elaborate hairstyles. Balloonmania has taken hold here and a number of the aristocrats even wear comical outfits that puff out like balloons.

Rich fabrics, golden tassels, and banners of King Auberon's face decorate the recreational balloons drifting over the city ramparts. You wonder if it's an accurate depiction or if the artist was pressured into accentuating his regal qualities. Tourists peer from dainty lacquer carriage windows while air taxis shuttle aristocrats and commuters swiftly through narrow tunnels and beneath skybridges.

    You'd never pass up a profitable opportunity, and the citizens of Ithora are some of the wealthiest in Tethyr. You plan to take advantage of that...

Of course, with only a rudder for steering, you wouldn't dare fly your airship through the narrow tunnels below. Maybe someday you could afford a better ship. Something faster, with more firepower, maneuverability, and cargo space. For now, you'll just have to make do with your old junker and the slow-traffic airspace it's permitted to fly in. 

Instead of joining the orderly line of superior steam-powered ships that hover mid-air with their high-tech propellers and powerful engine boosters, you enter a waiting loop, following other derelict airships in a circular pattern while waiting to be summoned by the hovering inspection shuttle nearby. 

Although your ship isn't the finest specimen around, you're still proud of it.

You gaze at the gray sky, thoughts numbed by the incessant sound of steadily grinding motors around you, when one of the high-tech cruisers — rocketing toward a manicured fairway with little gold carriages trundling about the rooftop's emerald hills  — suddenly aims directly at your airship. 

Several floorboards tremble underfoot as the cruiser, armored in impervious calicite metal, scrapes a layer of wood off your starboard hull. As you rush to inspect the damage, you see the pilot, a haughty teenage boy, pull an impossibly sharp U-turn, only possible due to the advanced Lyonese technology of his ship.

Within seconds he pulls alongside your ship, leaning his wirey frame over the fiberglass rail while whistling low. "You'd think such an eyesore would be illegal in a civilized place like Ithora... Why, even the old relic airships at the museum aren't [i]that[/i] dated." The sneering boy folds his arms over a vibrant coat adorned with ruffles and gems. Every inch of fabric seems perfectly cut and tailored to his form.

"Perhaps these junkers are commonplace in the primitive regions of Tethyr," his dark-haired female companion replies, flaunting her fashionable silk-spun, hand-tailored pilot clothes. "Imagine a levitating dustbin like that falling to pieces over mother's Astelmeran sky palace." 

"You here to gripe, or do you actually want something?" you ask.

"As you can see, my ship is ruined thanks to you," the boy replies. "How do you intend to compensate me for the damage you've caused?"

As your eyes travel down to the tiniest scrape blemishing the pristine white hull, you notice the emblem of the Volodeus medical corporation emblazoned on the side of the ship. You suddenly recognize the boy's arrogant face. He's the CEO's son. The newspapers were always cluttered with pointless stories about his destructive gadding. 
*comment As your eyes travel down to the tiniest scrape blemishing the pristine white hull, you notice the emblem of Volodeus medical corporation emblazoned on the side of the ship. You look back up and instantly recognize the boy's arrogant face. 

He clicks his fingers and a pair of Ithoran knights move to his side. As servants of King Auberon, the knights hold positions above the regular guard and rarely involve themselves with common riffraff like you. Yet here they are, protecting this pampered boy. 

"You owe me six hundred tethlas for the repairs," the boy says. Your snort of disbelief only makes him more aggressive. "If you country folk weren't so undisciplined and knew to stay in the proper zones it wouldn't have come to this in the first place."

You wonder if the zones actually exist or if he's just making it up...

This just goes to show, you shouldn't have permission to fly without an air license from the Royal Academy." 

      "The skies would certainly be safer if everyone had," you agree. "Sadly, our institutions are not nearly so grand on the outskirts."

"Sure thing," Flint says.

*comment The deck jolts underfoot as [i]$!{ship_name}[/i] lurches closer — forced into compliance like a dog on a leash. Attempt to flee now and you'd be blasted out of the sky by the security cannons stationed on the detention center roof below.

The deckhands exchange worried glances. You know exactly what they're thinking because the same thoughts are screaming through your mind. What's with the overbearing security measures? Did the Ithoran officers discover your identity? Did you leave some incriminating detail in sight?

A fold-out rampart extends from the side of the Ithoran shuttle like a tongue until the end reaches your deck. Then the shuttle door slides open soundlessly and an old matriarch-type woman marches out with a stern face, clad in a perfectly crisp uniform.

One look tells you that this is a no-nonsense kind of woman. You're not going to beat around the bush asking for favors. You're going to offer this officer exactly what she wants in as few words as possible. 

"Name?" she asks briskly, glancing down at her handheld database. No point lying. She'll be able to tell if you do.

The family name somehow stuck even though your parents abandoned you at a young age. You wonder what happened to them. Most of the children at the orphanage did.

Flint developed a mean streak and a fiery temper as a child for this very reason. His temper still flared up occasionally but for the most part he had learned control. He could so effortlessly ignore the harsh opinions of others that it was easy to forget how much criticism from you could crush him.

You never told anyone, not even Flint, but before leaving the orphanage you managed to get a hold of a single photograph of your parents. You saw aspects of yourself in their faces.

      You don't stop her from lifting a lid and inspecting one of the cabbages. "Food rations mostly. Almost everything's gone rotten though. Didn't think it would take so long to cross the Blackreef channel." You take the cabbage from her and fiddle with one of the leaves. "Keeps everyone in good health. All the right vitamins." You place the cabbage back inside the crate and close the lid. "Want a look inside the hold?" 

      Despite the officer being very nosy, you find different ways of diverting her attention from the hidden cargo stashes while torturing her with tedious explanations of how you decided to pursue your fortune in the big city. By the time you finish touring her around, she's so exhausted from listening to your waffle that she actually hurries to re-board her shuttle.

      "What's inside the crates?" the officer asks.

      You don't stop her from lifting a lid, but you get visibly nervous when she starts inspecting one of the cabbages. The officer notices your expression at once and tears the cabbage apart, finding a geminai core inside. "Trafficking geminai cores into Ithora is a serious offense."

      You run a hand through your hair, muttering under your breath, somehow prolonging your little act despite the mounting pressure. "Geminai cores? You're joking... I had a bad feeling about the job, but we were desperate. I figured, you know... just this once I could look the other way. And my deckhands actually trusted me. But can you blame them? They're starving. And it's my fault..."

      The officer glances at your emaciated deckhands suspiciously. "Times are rough, yes. But that doesn't excuse your behavior." 

      The officer checks your record on her database again. "This appears to be a first offense. Obviously the cores will be confiscated, but I'll let you off with a warning. Have your deckhands carry the crates over to my shuttle." 
		
      You haul one of crates over to the Ithoran shuttle while attempting to look remorseful rather than annoyed. Fortunately, the officer didn't think to check the hold because you seemed so forthcoming. 
		
      "We'll be keeping an eye on you from now on so stay out of trouble while you're in Ithora," says the officer. Once the crates have been loaded into her shuttle, she turns to leave. "Oh. And I'll be extracting a small fine from your account for breaking trade rules."

      You watch helplessly as one hundred tethlas are swiped from your account. It could be worse though. Somehow you managed to keep the old crone away from the hold. Surely delivering some of the cargo is better than delivering nothing, right...?

      "I didn't know there was anything other than cabbages in those crates, I swear!" The words jumble out of your mouth before you can stop them.

      "Give me a break. Those cabbages are expired by several days. You knew those cores were in there." The officer pulls out her database. "Well, we certainly can't have this happening again..." The officer then turns to her officers. "I want a full sweep of this ship! Check every nook and cranny!" 

      Before long, the crates stashed inside the hold lie exposed on deck. 

      "Obviously the cores will be confiscated," the officer explains while withdrawing an electronic database. "You're lucky this is a first offense or you'd be spending a few months behind bars." She adds a few additional notes to your record before turning to leave. "Oh. And I'll be extracting a small fine from your account for breaking trade rules intentionally."

      You watch helplessly as five hundred tethlas are swiped from your account. Your first smuggling operation isn't even over yet and you've hit rock-bottom. There's no cargo left and you've lost a good chunk of your savings. It's probably in your best interest to high-tail it from the city before your client gets wind of what just happened.

      Face burning with humiliation, you give the helmsmen their orders. "Just get us out of here. Anywhere," you say, before hurrying to your cabin. You need to be alone. To think. But Malikye follows you into the room before you can slam the door shut. 

      You reach for your pen, crushing it angrily in hand. If he doesn't get out in the next five seconds you might actually stab him with it.  

      Malikye sighs and leans against the door. "While you were destroying any chance we had to get the cargo through the inspection, I moved the cores. Some of them anyway."

      "Wait... you mean they didn't get everything?" You stand taller. "We still have cargo?"

      "Correct. Now you owe me. So pull your pathetic self together and get those cores to a buyer so I can get paid." Malikye shows himself out, slamming the door behind him.

    You draw a surge breaker from your coat and conceal it in the palm of your hand. The palm-sized devices are illegal in Tethyr but some shady salesman gave it to you months ago along with his card in case you needed more. 

    "What's inside the crates?" the officer asks.

    You don't stop her from lifting a lid and inspecting one of the cabbages. "Food rations mostly. Almost everything's gone rotten though."

          "What in Tethyr...?" The officer swivels on her polished heels and narrows her eyes. When the flickering stops, she shrugs and continues to examine the cabbage. The breath catches in your chest when a sparkling core peaks from the leaves, glinting in the sunlight, making her squint. "Is this...? No, it couldn't be..."

          The propellers on the Ithoran shuttle choke unexpectedly. An alarmed look appears on the officer's face as she waves her fellow officers forward impatiently. "Seize the cargo and return to the shuttle immediately. Something's wrong with the ship."  

          "Wait! That's not fair," you say. "You can't just leave in the middle of an inspection and take our property with you."

          "I can if our ship is malfunctioning," the officer says. "You can retrieve it from the station once we've had time to analyze it." 

          You frown and take your last look at the cargo as the officers cross to their shuttle. The moment they find the trafficked geminai cores, your name would soar to the top of Ithora's wanted list. At least they didn't have time to check the hull. You need to get what's left of the cargo off your ship fast.

    You approach the old woman as if you're about to address her. Instead, you smash your fist into her face. She sinks to the ground unconscious, blood spurting from her fractured nasal bone. Deckhands and officers draw their blades in unison. 

    You retreat to the quarter deck, cocking your pistol. With only two loaded pistols at hand you'll have to make each shot count. You kneel beside the control panel and position the barrel between two rails, angling for a clear shot. Below you, on the main deck, the battle rages on while you wait patiently for the right moment to strike. Then it happens. One of the officers edges away from the battle and races for the shuttle door to signal for help. 

    *if barbarism > 60
      You fire your first shot, easily handling the recoil as the gun powder explodes, sending a plume of smoke into the air. Right on target, the bullet pierces the man's leg. He tumbles over. You holster the used pistol and cock the second pistol. This time you notice one of your deckhands struggling to overpower an officer's blade. The blade is just about to slice into her neck when you successfully fire the second shot into the officer's shoulder. The deckhand seizes the moment to disarm her opponent. 

      With the fight won, you destroy any information they have on record of you and leave the survivors bound and gagged inside their own shuttle.

An alarm screeches from the speakers. You need to escape and fast but you have one bullet to spare. This time you notice one of your deckhands struggling to overpower an officer's blade. The blade is just about to bite into her neck when you successfully fire your second bullet into the officer's shoulder blade. The deckhand seizes the moment to disarm her opponent. 

      But it's not enough. The Ithoran officers overpower your starving deckhands and hold them at sword point. "Bind their hands with rope, seize all cargo on deck, and get that man's leg in a tourniquet!"

      You lean forward as the commanding officer ties your hands behind your back with a rope while her officers rush across the deck, dragging the cargo you worked so hard to protect into the shuttle.

Even if you get out of this alive, there'll be mutiny, unless you can escape before they check the cargo hold... 

      "Commander! These crates are filled with geminai cores!" one of the officers shouts.

      "Good grief... yesterday euphoria, today geminai cores..." the woman mutters. "Let me have a look." 

      As the commanding officer crosses the plank to inspect the cores, you begin wriggling your hands back and forth until a metallic file drops into your palm. You desperately cut through the thick rope strand by strand. By the time the officers finish gawking at the cores, you're free. You race for the control panel and force the airship to accelerate away from the metallic plank. The grappling hooks pull taut. You force the ship forward, watching the hooks splinter the planks apart, leaving extensive damage all over your hull.  

      "Back to the shuttle!" the commanding officer screams. "Signal the knights!"

      The few officers still aboard your airship leap across the gap before it's too late. You didn't want hostages anyway. But you still have business in the city.

    With the Ithoran officers distracted, it's time to make your move. Nodding to your co-pilots, you signal them to pull your airship out of the loop. Even if their sensors detect you, it'll be too late to stop you.

          Finally the wood holding the chains in place shatters, taking with it an entire length of the rail. Without anything to latch on to, the hooks drop harmlessly and swing like limp vines beneath the shuttle.

  Just when you're about to give up, the door opens. A wizened man with long ears, a long face, and skin like melted wax peers from the shadows. "Usually people use the front door when they want something."

  "I've got some unique items for sale. Heard you're the man to talk to," you say.

  The sunlight reflects off the jeweler's silver tresses as he considers you. "Let's make this quick."

  You start unloading the crates the moment the gap to your ship is close enough to cross. "These are fresh!" The jeweler's eyes widen as he holds one of the cores up to the light. "And young! Hargreaves's monopoly on quality cores is finally at an end!"

  "Hargreaves? The Alabaster Hargreaves? Head of research at Volodeus? What's he got to do with this?" Everyone knew the man to some degree; completely devoid of emotion, with hundreds of scandals involving his research and human rights abuse that always got hushed up in suspicious ways. If he's involved, that means it isn't just the black market you're dealing with. Somehow, you're not even the slightest bit surprised.

The under-city gives off a reprehensible first impression. Floor 67, or 'the Hive,' as it is referred to by your client, is a section of lower Ithora, hidden in the depths of a refuse factory where unsightly sorts, like smugglers, meet to exchange goods. 

"Captain $!{surname}?" The speaker, a young woman with auburn hair, greets you calmly as the tower door slides open to grant you access. There's a vacant look in her eyes and her stony expression seems unnatural and unbreakable.
 
"That's correct," you say as you wipe sweat from your brow. The unbearable heat and violent stream of humid air ceaselessly drives between the narrow walls from ventilation pipes protruding haphazardly from the ceiling. Each pipe expels a sickening smell, presumably the smell of dozens of dead rats decaying in the labyrinth of pipes required to service a city so grand. 

"Rough journey? I was starting to wonder if you got shipwrecked by the storm," the woman says, her eyes following your every movement.

"Nearly did," you admit, coughing violently as ash drifts down from the ceiling like black snow. "Never thought I'd say this, but your job makes mine seem pleasant. How do you breathe in here?"

"Not every retrieval location is this bad, but you get used to it. The city pays for the exterior upkeep, giving the city the illusion of being a supreme and endless palace. But the people who live on the lower floors are a little more down-to-earth." The woman gestures at a small cart. "Could you ask your crew to unload the cargo next to my cart?" 

"Of course." You signal your crew to begin unloading the cargo. "Some of the crates got damaged... Hope you don't mind."

The young woman runs a hand over one of the damaged crates. "So you know what's inside? Guess there's no point trying to hide it." The young woman hefts the lid off and starts picking the cabbages apart carefully, lowering the geminai cores into the cart while taking care to count each one. "Assuming most of the cores made it through, our employer likely will reach out to you again to offer another contract. If you're interested."

      "Hmm... between the high-risk cargo and dangerous route I'm not sure it would be a good idea to take another contract," you say. "What would you advise?"

      The young woman hesitates and folds her arms uncomfortably before answering. "Our client is dangerous and better off avoided in my opinion. It wouldn't be the first time someone who was working for him went missing. It's why I'm reluctant to resign myself. But you're not in the same position yet. I won't mention you saw the cargo." 

      "Surely he could be reported for this," you say. "If he got arrested you wouldn't be trapped here anymore."

      The young woman smiles sadly. "I appreciate your concern, but plenty of good people have tried to take Hargreaves down. It never works."

      "Wait... Hargreaves? The Alabaster Hargreaves? Head of research at Volodeus? What's he got to do with this?" Everyone knew the man to some degree; completely devoid of emotion, with hundreds of scandals involving his research and human rights abuse that always got hushed up in suspicious ways. If he's involved, that means it isn't just the black market you're dealing with. Somehow, you're not even the slightest bit surprised.

      "Er... yes. It's just a suspicion. But from the evidence I've seen, there's a good chance he's behind this particular operation. Please don't tell anyone I told you. If they find out... well, I don't like to think what might happen," the young woman says pleadingly.

      "Airship captains are always looking for crew," you suggest.

      "Are you making an offer?" The young woman shakes her head. "I couldn't afford to be away from the city for too long. My grandmother needs me. That's another thing. She needs someone around to look after her. And her medicine is expensive."

      "That would make it difficult to quit," you admit. "Though there's no harm in searching for other opportunities when you can. Eventually something better is bound to come your way."

      "You're right. I'll keep an eye on the papers and try for something else," the young woman says. "Even if the pay isn't quite as good."

      "Well of course. That's what everyone wants," you say.

      "Just like you brought the cores here instead of turning them in. You're just trying to look out for your crew," the young woman says.

"With that settled, I expect you'll need to purchase supplies for your next journey?" the young woman asks. "Ithora is plentiful in markets but, given your lack of proper documentation, you've got two choices really. First, there's the Diamond Causeway market. Plenty of selection and cheap prices, but it's crowded and the knights tend to notice people who stick out. There's also the fair trade market Helmsport on the Ithoran outskirts. Some people prefer to purchase straight from the farmers, but their produce is expensive and poor quality. Not many gardens grow on towers so the merchants are forced to bring in produce from the surrounding settlements."

But just as you step back onto the main deck, Ruby, Malikye, and Kaolin run up, panting and out of breath. "Trouble, cap'n! Stowaways in the store room! They must have snuck aboard when we stopped in at Westlok harbor. They demand to speak with you."

"The three of you couldn't figure out how to apprehend them?" you say, exasperated. You don't have time for this. Feet thundering across the floorboards — because you want them to hear doom approaching — you storm below deck and hurl the store room open. Ruby waits at the door, blocking the only escape route.

The store room is dark when you enter, most of the crates still squished together, side by side. Why did this have to happen to you, now of all times? You can only hope the stowaways don't jeopardize your operation further.

You're impatiently trying to dislodge the top-most crate from the makeshift fortress when two men leap out, clutching giant suitcases and screaming in terror.

    As the nearest stowaway angles for the door, you snag the collar of his ruffled shirt.

    "Help!" he cries. 

    His friend turns at once to hit you with the suitcase.

Then, careful not to make a sound, you creep behind the door and wait.

    A few seconds later you hear movements at the back of the room: crates shifting aside, the patter of footsteps and creaking floorboards. Next thing you know, two stowaways are scrambling for the door at once.

The two middle-aged noblemen sink to their knees before you. You draw your hair back — well away from your eyes — the better to view them. Tears stream down their pale, gaunt faces. Their large hands tremble in pristine white gloves and their spindly fingers dig into the soft silks of their colorful pantaloons. Both men boast well-trimmed mustaches, once artistically contoured but which now dangle limply over their mouths, attached to some thread of skin beneath their noses. 

At once you realize that neither of the men have known a day of hard labor. Your left eye twitches as you slowly draw your sword from its scabbard, thrusting the recently polished tip straight at them. "You sneak aboard like rats and expect me not to throw you overboard?"

"Ah, how could I forget... The one thing Ruby hates more than reality is pessimism," Malikye sneers.

"I don't trust them. They put the crew at risk," says Kaolin. "The authorities are offering a substantial reward. Why not drop them off, dust off our hands, and call it a day?"

"Do that and the geminai will reveal information about our smuggling operation in retaliation. It's what I'd do," says Malikye. "And I wouldn't be surprised if these so-called lawful authorities just gut them the moment we step out the door anyway."

That takes Kaolin by surprise. She traces a finger along her dragon tattoo thoughtfully. "Well... these geminai were influential members of society at some point. Having them in your debt might not be a bad thing. Then again, they might just be dishonest, self-interested aristocrats. And who could really blame them if they were?"

You consider the trembling geminai stowaways and prepare to make your decision.

The Diamond Causeway's landing platform is already crowded with impressive airships and vessels when you arrive and there's practically a stampede to get off the airship.

  The stowaways hesitate. "If you ever need help, seek the Jhinka brothers. We will do all for you that we can." With a bow, the stowaways excuse themselves, scurrying down the gangplank like mice in a cat's lair. You briefly wonder if you'll ever see them again.

Malikye hurries past, looking frantic, mumbling something about finding another job for the crew. Somehow he's managed to tame his lustrous locks and button his shirt properly for once. It's a rather costly ensemble he's wearing though. Some sort of three piece designer suit with actual crocodile loafers. No wonder he's always so desperate for money if that's how he dresses off duty. 

Though you have to admit, he fits right in...

Gentlemen with gray-streaked hair lounge outside their luxury cruisers, leaning casually against the polished hulls while their hands glitter with gold rings and diamond cuff-links. It's frustrating considering some of you are actually here for business, and these narcissistic space wasters are taking up valuable space to flaunt their wealth in each other's faces.

You shove your way through the crowd and exit the glamorous airlock. The market isn't far away, just a brisk jaunt across a glass-bottom bridge teeming with exotic fish and colorful coral. You stride forward, eager to get the shopping out of the way because you're earning a lot of repugnant looks. 

You certainly didn't think your presence would cause any sort of problem - until you start making your away across the ocean-themed promenade. People pause to stare, their unflinching gazes dissecting every visible layer of your clothing. Immediately, you get the feeling that you and your threadbare uniform are not welcome here. You honestly thought you'd be safe enough in the middle of a crowded street, until someone seizes you from behind.

"Well, well. What have we here? Looks like some sort of vagrant sneaking inside to panhandle. Tut tut... Can't be having that." The officer pinning you to the wall grins. He doesn't look very old. Probably new to the force, testing his newfound power. His grip on you is deadlock. Even if you fought back you'd need to put up an impressive fight to overpower muscles like his.

"If ${MC_heshe} tries to escape I'll tase ${MC_himher}." The second officer towers over you with a dead-pan face, flicking the switch on his little handheld device on and off so you can hear the fizzle of electricity.

"Wonder if ${MC_heshe}'ll try to put up a fight... Doesn't look like much of a fighter to me." 

With every advantage in their favor, these muscle-heads are definitely looking for a fight. It might be better to do something unexpected. They don't look very agile, but it would probably be easiest to just talk them down.

You hope he's not dead, but you had to be thorough. You still need to pick up groceries.

      He's overly helpful about the shopping, clearly intending to shorten your stay, which is just as well. Unfortunately it comes to a staggering sixty-seven hundred tethlas for groceries enough to feed the entire crew. After being detained yourself, you have no choice but to head straight back to your airship once the supplies are purchased.

The market itself is in shambles, run out of business by the monopolies in Ithora - at least according to the retired fishmonger who's busily picking grit from his rotting teeth with a toothpick. Of the ten buildings that surround the market square, nine are boarded up. Their shabby derelict signs dangle from the store fronts with faded letters. A few filthy street urchins peer from shattered windows, staring at you with hungry eyes, sizing you up before disappearing. You could easily handle three or four of them, but not a whole gang if they swarmed you with knives.

Ruby stuffs her hands in her uniform pockets. "Don't suppose we can head over to the Diamond Causeway?" 

"Not risking it. We'll just have to make the best we can of a bad situation." Your eyes skirt the wares. With the sun setting, the shops could close any minute, though the elderly woman, who seems to be overseeing the four remaining kiosks, seems eager for business.

With a sigh, Ruby trains her eyes on the provisions list. "Looks like we have enough tethlas to restock our provisions for once." Ruby hands the list to the elderly woman, who begins rummaging through the wares the kiosks, crossing ingredients and supplies off the list after she finds them and sets them aside. Salted beef and hard-tack, rye and barley flour, the choicest picks from the rotten carrots and scabby potatoes, and a few barrels of pickled herrings. 

"The crew won't be pleased when we bring back expired produce," says Ruby. "Why not try to cut a deal?" 

"[i]Try[/i] to cut a deal?" you say, frowning. "If I were her, I'd be giving this rotten produce away for free."

It's not a map of Ithora but you don't think the woman can see very well from where she's sitting. "How far is the Diamond Causeway from here? Surely they'd have some fresh produce."

      The old woman smiles. "How about I just give you the deal you're after? Half price? Say... forty three hundred tethlas? It's less than they'd charge you at the bazaar."

      "At a price that low I'll have to tell everyone they're the best scabby potatoes I've ever eaten." You fold the map back up and smile. Not a bad price, considering it's enough to feed the entire crew.

      "Wasn't my intention to," you say, relaxing your sword arm and forking over forty three hundred tethlas. Not a bad price, considering it's enough to feed the entire crew. 

      Ruby nods approvingly.

      "Surely you wouldn't charge someone such extortionate prices for produce that's already going bad?" you say, moving your hand over your pistol threateningly.

      "The prices are what they are. If you don't like 'em, you're free to shop elsewhere." To your surprise, the woman pulls a flintlock pistol from under the table and trains it on your face. "We don't respond well to threats round here. You want to get the edge on someone you better not hesitate. Don't mess around with the folks of Helmsport they say."

      "Easy now!" Ruby says, her eyes widening as a few children rush from the shadows of the nearby buildings. They surround you and wave their knives threateningly.

      "Okay, okay. You win. Let's not have bloodshed on the streets," you say, reluctantly forking over eighty three hundred tethlas for the moldy produce. "Full price it is."

      The old woman smiles a toothless smile. "Figured you'd see it my way."

      Ruby certainly doesn't look pleased.

      You approach the merchant with a friendly smile on your face. "Name's $!{name} and I'm new in Ithora. I run a shipping company and I'm looking for a place to purchase supplies regularly. I like that it's peaceful around here. Might not be such a good thing for you, but it's ideal for me. Would you be interested in some extra business?"

      The woman puffs her chest out proudly. "If you can offer me regular business then I'll see to getting some fresh produce in stock."

      "Of course," you say. "With Ithora being the capital and all, I figure we'll be in and out of here all the time. Now I'd be happy to buy up your entire stock here... but it needs to last the month."

      The merchant suddenly looks embarrassed. "If I knew you were coming..." She mumbles under her breath while doing some calculations on a scrap of paper. "Haven't had a new shipment in some time now... everything was just so quiet. Didn't see the point."

      You frown in a disappointed sort of way. "That's a shame. I was really hoping to make a purchase."

      "Well how about I give you a discount this time around? Let's say half price? And if you stop by regularly we can work out a regular discount that benefits us both," the woman offers.

      "Couldn't ask for more," you say, shaking her hand and forking over forty three hundred tethlas. Not a bad price, considering it's enough to feed the entire crew. 

      Ruby nods approvingly.

      You approach the merchant hesitantly and force a smile at the last minute. "Er... hello. I'm looking for a place to purchase supplies and this place looked pretty desperate for business so I figure you could give me a discount if I took these rotten potatoes off your hands."

      "How generous of you," the woman says sarcastically. "But no. I'll have to refuse your noble offer. There's plenty of starving children around here willing to help an old woman out for a rotten potato or two."

      "Oh come on," you say pleadingly. "Obviously we're both in a bad spot at the moment. Can't you cut me some sort of deal?"

      "Might've helped if you didn't waltz up and insult me to my face," says the woman, crossing her arms over her chest stubbornly. "The prices are what they are. If you don't like 'em, go elsewhere."  

      Unfortunately, you don't have much choice so you relent and accept the bill at full price. Ruby certainly doesn't look pleased.

You return to your airship to find an Ithoran knight waiting for you at the boarding platform. Your heart skips a beat. If you weren't carrying two baskets filled with supplies, your hand would have flown to the sword at your side.

"Are you the captain of this vessel?" he asks. He looks tired and uncomfortable, as if he's been at this all day.

    "A squire of the Ithoran guard," the young man replies, squaring his shoulders. 

    You quirk a brow at him.

    "Don't worry... you're not in trouble," the knight assures you. "I just need to make sure every captain on this docking platform receives a message from the king before I have permission to head home."

    "Let's have a look then. So we can both get some rest," you say.   
    *goto basket

*label basket

Tucking the basket under one arm nervously, you accept the three-page document which the knight extends to you. To your surprise, it's stamped with the official seal of Tethyr, which can only mean one thing. "An order from the king?" 

"There've been a few adjustments to the law. Geminai are now required to register with Volodeus. And any undocumented geminai are to be captured and given to authorities at soonest convenience in exchange for a reward."

"They're no longer protected under the law?" 

"Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore. Just read the document." The knight leans against the wall, rubbing the dark circles beneath his eyes. 

You stare down at the document in disbelief and horror. After receiving several reports of geminai stowing away aboard ships in an attempt to cross the Tethyr border, the king decreed that captains and their crews will be punished severely for harboring geminai. Something about radiation poisoning and public safety. The document advises all crews to take extra precautions when preparing for departure because it will be assumed that anyone caught with geminai on board is doing so intentionally. Perpetrators will be subject to treason and all the punishments that go along with it.

You're sharp enough to see that they're using the fear of others combined with the fear of being punished by authority to push a dark agenda forward. But why would they risk doing such a thing? Was it for profit? Or perhaps power? And would the good humans of Tethyr really be apathetic enough to let such an atrocity take place before their eyes? Might they even be complict in it?

    "You shouldn't be handing these decrees out if you don't agree with what they say," you say, raising the parchment.

    "I'll lose my job if I don't," the knight says. "And I don't have anything else lined up. My children would starve."

    "What are you going to do if your children turn out to be geminai?" you ask.

    The knight frowns uncomfortably. "They're not. But I see your point. I guess I'd be trying to sneak them out of the city right now."

    "You shouldn't have to flee from your own home. Nobody should," you say. "That's why this is so wrong."

    "Well what can we do about it?" the knight asks helplessly.

    "Why not speak to your fellow knights? You could convince them to stop handing the decrees out for a start."

    "What good will that do?" the knight asks. "They'll just fire us and hire someone else to do the job."

      "Well I did take an oath," the knight sighs. "Keep in mind you're asking me to put my neck on the line. I hope you're planning to do the same."

      "It would be cowardice not to," you assure him. "Well then. Is there anything else I should know before I head out?"

      You step back. "Easy there. I am planning to do something. As soon as I figure out what I can do," you say. The knight doesn't seem convinced. It might be best to push the conversation in another direction. "Anyway... is there anything else I should know before I head out?"

    The knight shrugs uncomfortably. "I don't know. I don't know the full story yet."

    "Well it doesn't sit right with me. I can't stand by and watch them put innocent people behind bars. If I did, what right would I have to complain if it happened to me?" you say.

    The knight shirks in his armor. "That's very noble of you, but I have a family to support and bills to pay... so I can't risk my job like that."

      "That's the one. One of his agents contacted me recently regarding a shipment of geminai cores," you say, tearing a page from your notebook. "The information's all here. With a bit of effort you might even get a promotion out of it."

      The knight accepts the paper curiously. "I'll certainly look into it, though I can't promise anything."

"You'll probably want to check your crew for readings. This device will help you detect geminai at close range." The Ithoran knight hands you a small palm-sized device. "Simply activate the button there, then move the device within a meter of the suspect. The little gem at the top will start glowing if it's a geminai."
  
So this is what the authorities were waiting for. Technology that could tell an geminai from a human without ripping the chest cavity open. You close your hand around the device and force yourself to remain calm. "Very well. And if I find geminai in my crew?"

"Undocumented geminai can be turned in at any checkpoint during entry," the knight explains. "If you're concerned about your safety, you can remove the geminai from your ship and file a report regarding their general whereabouts and appearance. Now I don't mean to cut our conversation short but my shift's done and I could use some shut-eye." 

You continue to stand there at the end of the gangplank long after the knight leaves. You're not quite sure how to break the news to your crew. The most concerning aspect of this whole mess, which strikes you instantly, is that anyone aboard your ship could be a geminai. Even Flint. And if Flint did turn out to be a geminai, what would you do?
